i made this project with the help of a Youtube Channel to help my understanding of NLP and Chatbots.

This project initially reads from the input.txt file that contains all of shakespeare's work and processes it.
As an output in tries to write a peice in Shakespeares language. 
 I have added comments on somelines for my own understanding and for you o follow alog too.
